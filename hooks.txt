Hooks provided by the MonoBook skin.

'MonoBookAfterContent': Called after #content has been closed but right
before #column-content is closed. You can use this to inject items (such as
ads, for example) from an extension.

'MonoBookAfterToolbox': Called in toolbox() after the toolbox portlet (#p-tb)
has been generated. You can use this to inject items (such as ads or a hit
counter, for example) from an extension.
This is the MonoBook couterpart to the VectorAfterToolbox hook in the Vector
skin.
